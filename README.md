**curves** is an R package that helps you create partial dependence and response plots for any
fitted model, leveraging the power of ggplot2 to produce elegant, publication-ready visuals.
Designed with both standard and spatial data in mind, it makes it easy to explore how a model’s
predictions change when focusing on a single predictor at a time, while holding all others 
constant. Whether you’re working with simple tabular data or complex geospatial structures,
**curves** provides a streamlined syntax that integrates seamlessly into typical R workflows, 
helping you quickly uncover and communicate the underlying relationships in your data.
